A very simple "webapp" for improving Cyrillic reading skills. It works by
fetching random words from Wikipedia using its API (actually, it searches
Wikipedia for playback samples).

The mechanism is simple: you are presented with some word and then you try to
read it. Once you think you got it, you can click wherever on the page and
a playback with correct pronunciation starts. Once it is finished you get some
new word and you repeat the process until you get bored.

The "interface" was created with mobile phones in mind (so you can practice
while on a bus or something) so this ascetic feel is by design and is not going
to change.
